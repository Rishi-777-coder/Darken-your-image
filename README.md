# Image Loader and Processor

## Description
This Python program allows users to paste the path of an image file and perform operations such as loading and displaying the image visually. It also supports image processing tasks, such as creating a "darkened" version of the image using NumPy.

## Features
- Load images from a file path provided by the user.
- Display the original image visually.
- Perform image processing to create a darkened version of the image.
- Supports multiple image formats including `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, and `.gif`.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for the implementation.
- **NumPy**: To handle and process image data.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: To load image files and convert them to NumPy arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: To visually display images.

## Prerequisites
Make sure the following libraries are installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pillow`

You can install these using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow
